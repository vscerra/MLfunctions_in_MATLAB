# MLfunctions_in_MATLAB
Repository for all functions written for the Andrew Ng machine learning course on Coursera. The functions/scripts are all in MATLAB/Octave code and use vectorized implementation rather than loops wherever possible. 

The functions here are only the ones necessary to complete assignments. Complete course materials can be found at Coursera.com
